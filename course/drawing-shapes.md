# Drawing Shapes

In this course we will learn programming by making the computer draw shapes.

Any programming language will have some primitive operations and the ways to combine the primitive operations to achive more complex tasks.


## Drawing Simple Shapes

In our setup, we have two primitives to draw a line and a circle.

```
circle(0, 0, 100)
```

## Exercise: Two Circles in a Row

Write a program to draw two circles, one besides the other.

```
# first circle
circle(100, 100, 50)

# draw the second circle besides the above circle

```
