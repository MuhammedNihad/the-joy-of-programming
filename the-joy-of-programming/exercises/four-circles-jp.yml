  # identify the four points
  p1 = Point(x=50, y=0)
  p2 = Point(x=0, y=50)
  p3 = Point(x=-50, y=0)
  p4 = Point(x=0, y=-50)

  # create four lines
  c1 = Circle(center=p1, radius=50)
  c2 = Circle(center=p2, radius=50)
  c3 = Circle(center=p3, radius=50)
  c4 = Circle(center=p4, radius=50)

  # show them
  show(c1, c2, c3, c4)
