title: Repeat 64
description: |
  Write a function `repeat64` to takes a shape as argument and
  repeats it 64 times in an 8x8 grid.

  Can you reuse the `repeat4` and/or the `repeat16` function that you
  wrote in the previous exercises to implement this?

code: |
  # the beside, below and grid functions are already defined for you
  def beside(a, b):
      a1 = a | scale(x=0.5) | translate(x=-75)
      b1 = b | scale(x=0.5) | translate(x=75)
      return a1 + b1

  def below(a, b):
      a1 = a | scale(y=0.5) | translate(y=75)
      b1 = b | scale(y=0.5) | translate(y=-75)
      return a1 + b1

  def grid(a, b, c, d):
      return below(
          beside(a, b),
          beside(c, d))

  # define the repeat64 function here


  # make a ball and cycle of it
  ball =  circle(fill="lightblue") + ellipse(fill="skyblue") + circle(x=80, y=0, r=20, fill="darkblue")
  shape = repeat64(ball)
  show(shape)

answer: |-
  # define the cycle function here
  def beside(a, b):
      a1 = a | scale(x=0.5) | translate(x=-75)
      b1 = b | scale(x=0.5) | translate(x=75)
      return a1 + b1

  def below(a, b):
      a1 = a | scale(y=0.5) | translate(y=75)
      b1 = b | scale(y=0.5) | translate(y=-75)
      return a1 + b1

  def grid(a, b, c, d):
      return below(
          beside(a, b),
          beside(c, d))

  def repeat4(shape):
    return grid(
      shape, shape,
      shape, shape)

  def repeat64(shape):
    return repeat4(repeat4(repeat4(shape)))

  # make a ball and cycle of it
  ball =  circle(fill="lightblue") + ellipse(fill="skyblue") + circle(x=80, y=0, r=20, fill="darkblue")
  shape = repeat64(ball)
  show(shape)
