  Write a program to draw a grid of shapes as shown in the figure
  below.
answer: |-
  def simple_grid(n):
      d = 300/n
      xstart = -150 + d/2
      ystart = 150 - d/2
      shapes = []

      for row in range(n):
          for column in range(n):
              x = xstart + d*column
              y = ystart - d*row
              shape = make_shape(d) | translate(x=x, y=y)
              shapes.append(shape)
      return combine(shapes)

  def make_shape(d):
      return ellipse(w=d, h=d/2) + ellipse(w=d/2, h=d)

  shape = simple_grid(6)
  show(shape)
