title: Diagonals
description: |
  Write a program to draw the diagonals of a square using
  the `line` function.

code: |
  # here is the square
  s = rectangle(w=200, h=200)
  show(s)

  # draw the diagonals
answer: |-
  # here is the square
  s = rectangle(w=200, h=200)
  show(s)

  d1 = line(x1=-100, y1=100, x2=100, y2=-100)
  d2 = line(x1=100, y1=100, x2=-100, y2=-100)
  show(d1, d2)
