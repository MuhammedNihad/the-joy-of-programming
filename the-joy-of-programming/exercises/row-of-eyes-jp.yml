answer: |-
  def make_row(n):
      w = 300/n
      xstart = -150 + w/2
      shapes = []

      for i in range(n):
          x = xstart + i * w
          shape = make_shape(w, i, n) | translate(x=x)
          shapes.append(shape)

      return combine(shapes)
  
  def make_shape(w, i, n):
      return ellipse(w=w, h=w/2) + circle(r=w/4, fill="black")

  shape = make_row(n=6)
  show(shape)
