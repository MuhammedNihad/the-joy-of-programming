title: Row of Growing Circles
description: |
  Write a program to draw a row of circles, starting
  with a small circle and increasing the size in each
  subsequent circle, with sizes of circles growing in
  equal increments.

  The `make_row` function is already provided for you. You just need to write
  the appropriate `make_shape` function.
answer: |-
  def make_row(n):
      w = 300/n
      xstart = -150 + w/2
      shapes = []

      for i in range(n):
          x = xstart + i * w
          shape = make_shape(w, i, n) | translate(x=x)
          shapes.append(shape)

      return combine(shapes)

  def make_shape(w, i, n):
      step = w/n/2
      r = (i+1)*step
      return circle(r=r)

  shape = make_row(n=6)
  show(shape)

  def make_row(n):
      w = 300/n
      xstart = -150 + w/2
      shapes = []

      for i in range(n):
          x = xstart + i * w
          shape = make_shape(w, i, n) | translate(x=x)
          shapes.append(shape)

      return combine(shapes)

  # implement make_shape function

  # create and show the row
  shape = make_row(n=6)
  show(shape)
