  Write a program to draw a row of shapes as shown in the figure below.
  Notice that the circle in each shape has a different shade of red,
  going from 0 to 255 in equal increments as done in one of the examples.
answer: |-
  def make_row(n):
      w = 300/n
      xstart = -150 + w/2
      shapes = []

      for i in range(n):
          x = xstart + i * w
          shape = make_shape(w, i, n) | translate(x=x)
          shapes.append(shape)

      return combine(shapes)

  def make_shape(w, i, n):
      step = 255/(n-1)
      r = i * step # the red component
      fill = color(r=r, g=0, b=0)
      return ellipse(w=w, h=w/2) + circle(r=w/4, fill=fill)

  shape = make_row(n=6)
  show(shape)
