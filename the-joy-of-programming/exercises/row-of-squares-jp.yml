title: Row of Concentric Squares
description: |
  Write a program to draw a row of shapes, with increasing
  number of concentric squares at each step as shown in the
  figure below.

answer: |-
  def make_row(n):
      w = 300/n
      xstart = -150 + w/2
      shapes = []

      for i in range(n):
          x = xstart + i * w
          shape = make_shape(w, i, n) | translate(x=x)
          shapes.append(shape)

      return combine(shapes)

  def make_shape(w, i, n):
      return concentric_squares(w, i+1)

  def concentric_squares(w, n):
      step = w/n
      wstart = step
      shapes = []
      for i in range(n):
          wh = wstart + i * step
          shapes.append(rectangle(w=wh, h=wh))
      return combine(shapes)

  shape = make_row(n=6)
  show(shape)
