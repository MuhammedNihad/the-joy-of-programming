  def wheel(x, y, r):
    d = 2*r/3
    c1 = circle(x, y, r)
    c2 = circle(x, y, r/3)
    c3 = circle(x-d, y, r/3)
    c4 = circle(x+d, y, r/3)
    c5 = circle(x, y-d, r/3)
    c6 = circle(x, y+d, r/3)
    return c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5 + c6

  shape = wheel(x=0, y=0, r=150)
  show(shape)

  # write function wheel



  # draw a wheel by calling that function
  shape = wheel(x=0, y=0, r=150)
