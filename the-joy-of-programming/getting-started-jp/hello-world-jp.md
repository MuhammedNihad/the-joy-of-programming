# Hello, world!

It is a tradition of programmers to write the first program to display
the message _Hello, world!_.

Let's write our first program in Python to display that message.

```{.python .joy .example}
print("Hello, world!")
```

The `print` is a function that takes a value as input and displays it
on the screen. We've passed a text value `"Hello, world!"` as input to
the print function.

The text values are called strings in Python. Strings are enclosed either
in double quotes of single quotes.

If you don't put quotes, then Python will complain. For example `print(hello)`
will not work, but `print("hello")` will.
